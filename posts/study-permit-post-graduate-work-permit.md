As an international student, with a valid student visa, you may be able to work while you are studying. Students can work 20 hours per week during academic sessions, and full-time during holidays. Spouse of the foreign national with a valid study visa can apply for an open work permit and any accompanying minor children can study for free.

After completion of studies, you may be able to apply for Post Graduate Work Permit (PGWP) and then apply for Permanent Residence under Canadian Experience Class (CEC). To be eligible for PGWP the student must have graduated from a Designated Canadian Post-secondary institution (ESL/Preparatory programs are not eligible). PGWP is generally issued for the same length of study program if the program was more than eight months, but under two years. If the length of study program was more than two years, the PGWP may be issued for three years.

Plan to apply well ahead of time since affirmations and grants get troublesome when you apply close to
the cut-off time. It is smarter to apply 6 months before the course start date to avoid last minute stress.
