eTA is required for all visa-exempt foreign nationals who wish to transit through or fly to Canada. If they
wish to visit by land or sea, then they only require their valid passport issued by a visa exempt country.
The only exception is U.S. Citizens, they can travel to Canada on a valid U.S. Passport, and do not require
a visitor visa or ETA, provided they are not staying for a period longer than six months.
