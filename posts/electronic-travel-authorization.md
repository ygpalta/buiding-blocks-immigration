about: 'An Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) is an electronic authorisation to fly to or transit through
a Canadian airport without a visa.'
---

eTA is required for all visa-exempt foreign nationals who wish to transit through or fly to Canada. If they
wish to visit by land or sea, then they only require their valid passport issued by a visa exempt country.
The only exception is U.S. Citizens, they can travel to Canada on a valid U.S. Passport, and do not require
a visitor visa or ETA, provided they are not staying for a period longer than six months.
