Like a foreign national needing a work permit to work in Canada, in most cases Canadian employers need to apply for a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) from the Government of Canada to allow them to hire foreign workers. An LMIA confirms that the foreign national will help fill the shortage in the Canadian Labour Market which could not be filled by a Canadian citizen or permanent resident.

After a positive LMIA is granted, the employer extends the temporary job offer to the foreign worker who can then apply for work permit based on that LMIA.
