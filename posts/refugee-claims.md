about: 'Settle in Canada as a Refugee'

Refugees are generally defined as individuals who are outside of their home country and are unable to
return because of well founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, political opinion, nationality
or being a part of a social group.

A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of
nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence,
would subject them to torture, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and risk to their life.
To come to Canada and resettle as a refugee you must be sponsored by the United Nations Refugee
Agency (UNHCR) or a private sponsorship group. Also, for sponsorship you must belong to either the
Convention refugee abroad class or Country of asylum class. We can help you resettle as a refugee.
You can make a refugee claim from within Canada if you fear persecution or your life would be in danger
if you leave. To make the claim, you must be in Canada and not subject to a removal order.
